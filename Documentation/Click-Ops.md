**Click-ops** refers to the practice of managing and configuring cloud infrastructure, servers, or applications through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) - such as clicking buttons and menus in platforms like Azure Portal - rather than using automated or code-based methods.

While click-ops can be convenient for quick tasks, demos, or learning, it’s often discouraged in production environments because it’s hard to track, reproduce, and version-control manual clicks. Instead, teams are encouraged to use [Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)](Infrastructure-as-Code%20(IaC).md) tools (like [Terraform](Terraform.md)) to ensure consistency, automation, and auditability in their operations.
